<h3>Vim</h3>

<h2>search and replace</h2>

<p>:%s/foo/bar/g
Find each occurrence of 'foo', and replace it with 'bar'. 0</p>

<p>:%s/foo/bar/gc
Change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first. </p>

<p>:%s/\<foo\>/bar/gc
Change only whole words exactly matching 'foo' to 'bar'; ask for
confirmation. </p>

<p>:%s/foo/bar/gci
Change each 'foo' (case insensitive) to 'bar'; ask for  confirmation. </p>

<p>:%s/foo/bar/gcI
Change each 'foo' (case sensitive) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation. </p>

<p>The g flag means global â€” each occurrence in the line is changed, rather than just the first. </p>

<p>Search range:</p>

<p>The % in :%s applies the substitute to every line in the buffer, rather
    than just the current line. 
:5,12s/foo/bar/g will change each 'foo' to 'bar' for all lines between
        line 5 and line 12. 
:'a,'bs/foo/bar/g will change each 'foo' to 'bar' for all lines
            between marks a and b. 
:.,$s/foo/bar/g will change each 'foo' to 'bar' for all lines
                between the current line (.) and the last line ($). 
:.,+2s/foo/bar/g will change each 'foo' to 'bar' for the
                    current line (.) and the two next lines (+2). 
                        (Note that :%s is equivalent to :1,$s.) </p>

<p>When searching:</p>

<p>\/ is / (use backslash + forward slash to search for forward slash) 
        \t is tab, \s is whitespace 
\n is newline, \r is CR (carriage return = Ctrl-M = ^M) </p>

<p>When replacing:</p>

<p>\r is newline, \n is a null byte (0x00). 
                    \&amp; is ampersand (&amp; is the search pattern). </p>

<h3>pandoc</h3>

<p>To convert <code>hello.html</code> from html to markdown: 
    pandoc -f html -t markdown hello.html
to restructured text (rest)
pandoc -f html -t rst hello.html</p>
