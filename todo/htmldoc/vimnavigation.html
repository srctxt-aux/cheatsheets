<p>This article is part of the ongoing Vi / Vim Tips and Tricks series. Navigation is a vital part of text editing. To be very productive, you should be aware of all possible navigation shortcuts in your editor. In this article, let us review the following 8 Vi / Vim navigation options.</p>

<pre><code>Line navigation

<p>Following are the four navigation that can be done line by line.</p>

<pre><code>k – navigate upwards
j – navigate downwards
l – navigate right side
h – navigate left side
</code></pre>

<p>By using the repeat factor in VIM we can do this operation for N times. For example, when you want to
go down by 10 lines, then type “10j”.</p>

<p>Within a line if you want to navigate to different position, you have 4 other options.</p>

<pre><code>0 – go to the starting of the current line.
^ – go to the first non blank character of the line.
$ – go to the end of the current line.
g_ – go to the last non blank character of the line.

ctrl+f – Jump forward one full screen.
ctrl+b – Jump backwards one full screen
ctrl+d – Jump forward (down) a half screen

</code></pre>

E – go to the end of the current WORD.

</code></pre>
