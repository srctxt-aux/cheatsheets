<h2>The gnupg vim plugin</h2>

<p>These are just a few notes after I lost a few hours of work by overwriting a secret file with 0.</p>

<p>There was a bit of vim rage involved. Plus I don't have the time to investigate were it went wrong. But when I look back to my - so far pleasant - past with this plugin, I come to the conclusion</p>

<pre><code>- Ecrypt with keyfile (`gpg -e -r 'julian' vstheworld.txt`) =&gt; GOOD

- Encrypt with password (`gpg -c asciiporn.txt`) =&gt; BAD
</code></pre>

<h2>Encrypt a file with a keyfile</h2>

<p>It's more secure, vim doesn't ask you each time for the password. But when you loose the keyfile, you NEVER get to the data again.</p>

<pre><code>gpg -e -r &lt;recipient&gt; FILE
</code></pre>

<p>That means you have to know your recipients.</p>

<pre><code>gpg --list-secret-keys

...
uid       santa
...
</code></pre>

<p>Ready go</p>

<pre><code>gpg -e -r 'santa' wishes.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Thats all.</p>
