Use ssh with scp keys
----------------------

If you defined ssh keys you can use them:

- with the -i option you can choose your id file in ~/.ssh

	ssh -i myfile jdoe@myserver.com:~/

- or you even can use a handle from a server defined in ~/.ssh/config (without username and fqn)

	scp myfile remoteserver:~/
