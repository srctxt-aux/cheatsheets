autoconf
========

Autoconf is a tool for producing shell scripts that automatically configure software source code packages to adapt to many kinds of UNIX-like systems. The configuration scripts produced by Autoconf are independent of it when they are run.

Together with Automake and Libtool, Autoconf forms the GNU build system.
