Unix pipes for bash and some common commands

***


The pipe mechanism lets you do amazing stuff:

1. print multiline text and a footer text in an anonymous block

3. Pipe it to a command

4. Pipe it to a loop


### Commands

while read

xargs


### 1. Print multiline text

    { # anonymous block
        cat <<\EOF       # multiline trick
hello you
have a nice holiday
EOF
    cat ./footer.txt
    } | 
    grep 'h' |
    while read word     # loop line per line
        do
            echo "word: $word"
    done
        
        }
